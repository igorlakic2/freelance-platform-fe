## Description
Freelance platform that connects **clients**, who post jobs, with **freelancers**, who can apply for those jobs.

Users with the **administrator** role can:
+ Manage all jobs (_create, update, delete, approve_)    
+ Manage all users (_create, update, delete_)
---
Users with the **client** role can:
+ Manage their own jobs (_create, update, delete_)
+ View applications for their jobs (_see list of freelancers who applied and approve them_)
+ Manage their profile
---
Users with the **freelancer** role can:
+ Browse and apply to available jobs
+ View a list of their submitted proposals
+ Manage their profile
